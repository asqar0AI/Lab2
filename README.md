# Stack and Queue Implementations in Java

This repository contains two stack and two queue implementations in Java using linked lists and array lists.

## MyLinkedListStack

This class implements a stack using a linked list. It has the following methods:

- `push(item)`: adds an element to the top of the stack.
- `pop()`: removes and returns the top element of the stack.
- `peek()`: returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
- `isEmpty()`: returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.
- `size()`: returns the number of elements in the stack.

## MyArrayListStack

This class implements a stack using an array list. It has the same methods as MyLinkedListStack.

## MyLinkedListQueue

This class implements a queue using a linked list. It has the following methods:

- `enqueue(item)`: adds an element to the back of the queue.
- `dequeue()`: removes and returns the front element of the queue.
- `peek()`: returns the front element of the queue without removing it.
- `isEmpty()`: returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.
- `size()`: returns the number of elements in the queue.

## MyArrayListQueue

This class implements a queue using an array list. It has the same methods as MyLinkedListQueue.

All classes have been implemented using Java Generics, so they can be used with any type of objects.
